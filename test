    I learned about layouts in CodeIgniter.
    layouts are used to make the code more readable and easy to understand.
    And i modified the code to make it more readable (changed all the views and controllers that used the old way).

    I did the page dynamic linking where we add a page in the database with it's content and we can edit this content using CKEditor and we can access it using the url from the lable attribut website/label.


    I am trying to make the images work with ckeditor but i am having some problems with it.

    I didn't succeed in making the images work with ckeditor.

    now i am working on the annuaire page.


    I Created a way to have infinite number of pages in the website (routes, pages, html content) from the database.

    I learned the diffrence between development and production environment (And i learned the hard way that i should always work in the development environment).

    I learned how to connect two databases in the same project in codeigniter.
